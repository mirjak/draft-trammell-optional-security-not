--- abstract

This document explores the common properties of security protocols and
extensions in order to provide recommendation for future efforts on
developing and deplying securtiy protocols.

First of all, it must be observed that due to the base-rate fallacy and general issues with
coordinated deployment of protocols under uncertain incentives, optional
security protocols or extensiosn have proven difficult to deploy in practice.
Further, it should be noted that secure transport protocols often consist of
three logically distinct components: transport, control (handshake), and record protection.
This document proposes that if these three functions can be logical separated,
encryption and authentication can be provided more flexibly on each layer of the stack,
instead on re-inventing these functions separately for each protocol.

This document defines the problem, examines efforts to add optional security for routing,
naming, and end-to-end transport, and extracts guidelines for future efforts to
deploy security protocols based on successes and failures to date.

# Introduction

Many of the protocols that make up the Internet architecture were designed and
first implemented in an envrionment of mutual trust among network engineers,
operators, and users, on computers that were incapable of using cryptographic
protection of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for those protocols,
in a legal environment where the distribution of cryptographic technology was
largely restricted by licensing and/or prohibited by law. The result has been a
protocol stack where security properties have been either added in retrospect
to core protocols using those protocols' extension mechanisms or implemented
in a separate layer.

As extension mechanisms are by design optional features of a protocol, this
has led to a situation where security is optional up and down the protocol
stack. Protocols with optional security have proven to be difficult to deploy.
This document describes and examines this problem, and provides guidance for
future evolution of the protocol, based on current work in network measurement
and usable security research.

{{I-D.kuehlewind-taps-crypto-sep}} further analyses existing security protocol
and notes that they often consist of three logically distinct components: transport,
control (handshake), and record protection. Separating these functions can provide
higher flexibility for new protocols to use and implement encryption and
authentication. Even if security is used and required on different layers of the 
stack, to protect header information or functions of that protocol, only
one handshake between the same two entities would be nessecary. Further,
the transport used for the handshake does not need to be same as used to the
actual data exchange.  Increasing flexibility here simplifies the introduction
of security functions where needed and actually provides security as a function
compontent to each layer, rather than separating it out into the separate layer
which has the risk to be optionally blocked or disabled.

# Problem statement

Consider an optional security extension with the following properties:

1. The extension is optional: a given connection or operation will succeed
   without the extension, albeit without the security properties the extension
   guarantees.
2. The extension has a true positive probability P: the probability that it
   will cause any given operation to fail, thereby successfully preventing an
   attack that would have otherwise succeeded had the extension not been
   enabled. This probability is a function of the extension's effectiveness as
   well as the probability that said operation will be an instance of the
   attack the extension prevents.
3. The extension has a false positive probability Q: the probability it will
   cause any given operation to fail due to some condition other than an
   attack, e.g. due to a misconfiguration.

Moving from no deployment of an optional security extension to full deployment
is a protocol transition as described in {{?RFC8170}}. We posit that the
implicit transition plans for these protocols have generally suffered from an
underestimation of the disincentive (as in section 5.2 of {{RFC8170}}) linked to
the relationship between P and Q for any given protocol.

Specifically, if Q is much greater than P, then any user of an optional
security extension will face an overwhelming incentive to disable that
extension, as the cost of dealing with spuriously failing operations
overwhelms the cost of dealing with relatively rare successful attacks. This
incentive becomes stronger when the cause of the false positive is someone
else's problem; i.e. not a misconfiguration the user can possibly fix. This
situation can arise when poor design, documentation, or tool support elevates
the incidence of misconfiguration (high Q), in an environment where the attack
models addressed by the extension are naturally rare (low P).

This is not a novel observation; a similar phenomenon following from the
base-rate fallacy has been studied in the literature on operational security,
where the false positive and true positive rates for intrusion detection
systems have a similar effect on the applicability of these systems. Axelsson
showed {{Axelsson99}} that the false positive rate must be held extremely low,
on the order of 1 in 100,000, for the probability of an intrusion given an
alarm to be worth the effort of further investigation.

Indeed, the situation is even worse than this. Experience with operational
security monitoring indicates that when Q is high enough, even true positives
P may be treated as "in the way".

# Case studies

Here we examine four optional security extensions, BGPSEC {{?RFC8205}}, RPKI
{{?RFC6810}}, DNSSEC {{?RFC4033}}, and the addition of TLS to HTTP/1.1
{{?RFC2818}}, to see how the relationship of P and Q has affected their
deployment. 

We choose these examples as all four represent optional security, and that
perfect deployment of the associated extensions -- securing the routing control
plane, the Internet naming system, and end-to-end transport (at least for the
Web platform) -- would represent completely "securing" the Internet architecture
at layers 3 and 4.

## Routing security: BGPSEC and RPKI

The Border Gateway Protocol {{?RFC4271}} (BGP) is used to propagate
interdomain routing information in the Internet. Its original design has no
integrity protection at all, either on a hop-by-hop or on an end-to-end basis.
In the meantime, the TCP Authentication Option {{?RFC5925}} (and MD5
authentication {{?RFC2385}}, which it replaces) have been deployed to add
hop-by-hop integrity protection.

End-to-end protection of the integrity of BGP announcements is protected by
two complementary approaches. Route announcements in BGP updates protected by
BGPSEC {{?RFC8205}} have the property that the every Autonomous System (AS) on
the path of ASes listed in the UPDATE message has explicitly authorized the
advertisement of the route to the subsequent AS in the path. RPKI {{?RFC6810}}
protects prefixes, granting the right to advertise a prefix (i.e., be the
first AS in the AS path) to a specific AS. RPKI serves as a trust root for
BGPSEC, as well.

These approaches are not yet universally deployed. BGP route origin
authentication approaches provide little benefit to individual deployers until
it is almost universally deployed {{Lychev13}}. RPKI route origin validation is
similarly deployed in about 15% of the Internet core; two thirds of these
networks only assign lower preference to non-validating announcements. This
indicates significant caution with respect to RPKI mistakes {{Gilad17}}. 

There are indications that this caution may be abating. At the RIPE 78 meeting
in May 2019, Job Snijders reported that networks are beginning to validate
route origins, especially on peering sessions {{Snijders19}}. Concerted effort
to improve tooling for RPKI signing and validation have reduced Q.  Deployment
is acclerating, which Snijders attributes in part to fear of missing out: as
individual networks deploy validation and find that the risk to availability
is lower than feared, and their operators realize that the added security of
rejecting RPKI invalid announcements can be used as a competetive advantage.
The actions of smaller networks can drive to decisions by larger ones:
Snijders relates a story in which the current "snowball effect" began with a
single small operator in the Netherlands announcing that they were rejecting
invalids, and that nothing bad had happened.

## DNSSEC

The Domain Name System (DNS) {{?RFC1035}} provides a distributed protocol for
the mapping of Internet domain names to information about those names. As
originally specified, an answer to a DNS query was considered authoritative if
it came from an authoritative server, which does not allow for authentication
of information in the DNS. DNS Security {{?RFC4033}} remedies this through an
extension, allowing DNS resource records to be signed using keys linked to
zones, also distributed via DNS. A name can be authenticated if every level of
the DNS hierarchy from the root up to the zone containing the name is signed.

The root zone of the DNS has been signed since 2010. As of 2016, 89% of TLD
zones were also signed. However, the deployment status of DNSSEC for
second-level domains (SLDs) varies wildly from region to region and is generally
poor: only about 1% of .com, .net. and .org SLDs were properly signed
{{DNSSEC-DEPLOYMENT}}. Chung et al found recently that second-level domain
adoption was linked incentives for deployment: TLDs which provided direct
financial incentives to SLDs for having correctly signed DNS zones tend to have
much higher deployment, though these incentives must be carefully designed to
ensure that they measure correct deployment, as opposed to more easily-gamed
indirect metrics {{Chung17}}.

However, the base-rate effect tends to reduce the use of DNSSEC validating
resolvers, which remains below 15% of Internet clients {{DNSSEC-DEPLOYMENT}}.

DNSSEC deployment is hindered by other obstacles, as well. Since the organic
growth of DNS software predates even TCP/IP, even EDNS, the foundational
extension upon which DNSSEC is built are not universally deployed, which
inflates Q. The current DNS Flag Day effort (see https://dnsflagday.net) aims to
remedy this by purposely breaking backward interoperability with servers that
are not EDNS-capable, by coordinating action among DNS software developers and
vendors.

In addition, for the Web platform at least, DNSSEC is not percieved as having
essential utility, given the deployment of TLS and the assurances provided by
the Web PKI (on which, see {{http-over-tls}}). A connection intercepted due to a
poisoned DNS cache would fail to authenticate unless the attacker also obtained
a valid certificate from the name, rendering DNS interception less useful, in
effect, reducing P.

## HTTP over TLS

Security was added to the Web via HTTPS, running HTTP over TLS over TCP, in
the 1990s {{?RFC2818}}. Deployment of HTTPS crossed 50% of web traffic in
2017.

Base-rate effects didn't hinder the deployment of HTTPS per se; however, until
recently, warnings about less-safe HTTPS configurations (e.g. self-signed
certificates, obsolete versions of SSL/TLS, old ciphersuites, etc.) were less
forceful due to the prevalence of these configurations. As with DNS Flag Day,
making changes to browser user interfaces that inform the user of low-security
configurations is facilitated by coordination among browser developers
{{ChromeHTTPS}}. If one browser moves alone to start displaying warnings or
refusing to connect to sites with less-safe or unsafe configurations, then users
will tend to percieve the safer browser as more broken, as websites that used to
work don't anymore: i.e., non-coordinated action can lead to the false
perception that an increase in P is an increase in Q. This coordination
continues up the Web stack within the W3C {{SecureContexts}}.

The Automated Certificate Management Environment {{?ACME=I-D.ietf-acme-acme}}
has further accelerated the deployment of HTTPS on the server side, by
drastically reducing the effort required to properly manage server certificates,
reducing Q by making configuration easier than misconfiguration. Let's Encrypt
leverages ACME to make it possible to offer certificates at scale for no cost
with automated validation, issuing 90 million active certificates protecting 150
million domain names in December 2018 {{LetsEncrypt2019}}.

Deployment of HTTPS accelerated in the wake of the Snowden revelations. Here,
the perception of the utility of HTTPS has changed. Increasing confidentiality
of Web traffic for openly-available content was widely seen as not worth the
cost and effort prior to these revelations. However, as it became clear that the
attacker model laid out in {{?RFC7624}} was a realistic one, content providers
and browser vendors put the effort in to increase implementation and deployment.

The ubiquitous deployment of HTTPS is not yet complete; however, all indications
are that it will represent a rare eventual success story in the ubiquitous
deployment of an optional security extention. What can we learn from this
success? We note that each endpoint deciding to use HTTPS saw an immediate
benefit, which is an indicator of good chances of success for incremental
deployment {{RFC8170}}. However, the acceleration of deployment since 2013 is
the result of the coordinated effort of actors throughout the Web application
and operations stack, unified around a particular event which acted as a call to
arms. While there are downsides to market consolidation, the relative
consolidation of the browser market has made coordinated action to change user
interfaces possible, as well as making it possible to launch a new certificate
authority (by adding its issuer to the trusted roots of a relatively small
number of browsers) from nothing in a short period of time.

# Discussion and Recommendations

It has been necessary for all new protocol work in the IETF to consider
security since 2003 {{?RFC3552}}, and the Internet Architecture Board
recommended that all new protocol work provide confidentiality by default in
2014 {{IAB-CONFIDENTIALITY}}; new protocols should therefore already not rely on
optional extensions to provide security guarantees for their own operations or
for their users.

In many cases in the running Internet, the ship has sailed: it is not at this
point realistic to replace protocols relying on optional features for security
with new, secure protocols. While these full replacements would be less
susceptible to base-rate effects, they have the same misaligned incentives to
deploy as the extensions the architecture presently relies on.

The base rate fallacy is essential to this situation, so the P/Q problem is
difficult to sidestep. However, an examination of our case studies does suggest
incremental steps toward improving the current situation:

- When natural incentives are not enough to overcome base-rate effects, external
  incentives (such as financial incentives) have been shown to be effective to
  motivate single deployment decisions. This essentially provides utility in the
  form of cash, offseting the negative cost of high Q.
- While "flag days" are difficult to arrange in the current Internet,
  coordinated action among multiple actors in a market (e.g. DNS resolvers or
  web browsers) can reduce the risk that temporary breakage due to the
  deployment of new security protocols is perceived as an error, at least
  reducing the false perception of Q.
- Efforts to automate configuration of security protocols, and to improve
  tooling for managing secure operations, can reduce the incidence of
  misconfiguration Q, and have had a positive impact on deployability.

Coordinated action has demonstrated success in the case of HTTPS, so examining
the outcome (or failure) of DNS Flag Day will provide more information about the
likelihood of future such actions to move deployment of optional security
features forward. It is difficult to see how insights on coordinated action in
DNS and HTTPS can be applied to routing security, however, given the number of
actors who would need to coordinate to make present routing security approaches
widely useful. We note, however, that the MANRS effort (https://www.manrs.org)
provides an umbrella activity under which any future coordination might take
place.

We note that the cost of a deployment decision (at least for DNSSEC) could
readily be extracted from the literature {{Chung17}}. Extrapolation from this
work of a model for determining the total cost of full deployment of DNSSEC (or,
indeed, of comprehensive routing security) is left as future work.
